      "contents": "\nBio\nI grew up in New Jersey and completed my undergraduate career in\nsun-soaked Coral Gables, FL. I graduated from the University of Miami\n(Go ’Canes!) in May of 2021 with departmental honors and a Bachelor of\nScience in Psychology with minors in Art and Chemistry. After trekking\nacross the country with my adorable cat, Momo, I\nam currently working as a post-baccalaureate lab manager at the Biology and Emotion of Addiction Via\nExperimental and Reproducible Science (BEAVERS) Laboratory, part of\nthe School\nof Psychological Science at Oregon State University in Corvallis,\nOR. We examine the complex psychophysiological relationship between\naddiction, substance use and affect (e.g., anxiety).\nIn the future, I plan on applying to Clinical Psychology\nPh.D. programs in pursuit of reforming the clinical realm, helping\nindividuals find healing and reducing stigma surrounding mental health\nissues. I am particularly interested in emotional dysregulation,\npsychotherapy techniques, psychedelic medicine and mindfulness research.\nI hope to one day be able to combine these interests into research and\ntreatment of addiction, emotional disorders and trauma.\nAs someone that values perspective and holds marginalized identities,\nI am incredibly passionate about diversity, equity and inclusion of all\nindividuals in all spaces. I strive to create safe spaces of\nacceptance in each of my interactions. I am also an advocate of\nopen science practices – including\nreproducibility and transparency.\nIn my free time, I enjoy reading, creating art of many kinds,\nlistening to music, walking in nature, practicing yoga, expressing\ngratitude and watching documentaries.\nEducation\nB.S. in Psychology | University of Miami | 2021\nInterests\nAddiction and trauma research\nEmotional regulation\nClinical work\nMental health advocacy\nOpen science\nArt creation\nYoga and mindfulness\nExpanding my knowledge base\nExpressing gratitude\nListening to music\nSkills\nTrilingual (English, Portuguese, Italian)\nR website design\nMicrosoft Office\nAdobe Acrobat, Photoshop and Illustrator\nLogo design\nDistill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing,\nnative to the web.\nLearn more about using Distill for R Markdown at https://rstudio.github.io/distill.\n\n\n\n",
