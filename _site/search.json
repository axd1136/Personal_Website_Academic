      "contents": "\nBio\nI grew up in New Jersey and completed my undergraduate career in sun-soaked Coral Gables, FL. I graduated from the University of Miami (Go ’Canes!) in May of 2021 with departmental honors and a Bachelor of Science in Psychology with minors in Art and Chemistry. After trekking across the country with my adorable cat, Momo, I served as a post-baccalaureate lab manager at the Biology and Emotion of Addiction Via Experimental and Reproducible Science (BEAVERS) Laboratory, part of the School of Psychological Science at Oregon State University in Corvallis, OR.\nI am currently a second-year graduate student in the Counseling Psychology PhD program at Colorado State University. I am working with Dr. Noah Emery, whose research centers around investigating the protective factors of positive affect in substance use in young people. With his counsel, I hope to learn more about conducting rigorous ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and intervention (EMI). I am looking forward to learning from all of the incredible faculty and graduate students in this program.\nAs someone that values perspective and holds marginalized identities, I am incredibly passionate about diversity, equity and inclusion of all individuals in all spaces. I strive to create safe spaces of acceptance in each of my interactions. I am also an advocate of open science practices – including reproducibility and transparency.\nIn my free time, I enjoy reading, creating art of many kinds, listening to music, walking in nature, practicing yoga, expressing gratitude and watching documentaries.\nEducation\nM.S. in Psychology | Colorado State University | Anticipated May 2025\nB.S. in Psychology | University of Miami | 2021\nInterests\nAddiction and trauma research\nEmotional dysregulation\nClinical work\nMental health advocacy\nOpen science\nArt creation\nYoga and mindfulness\nExpanding my knowledge base\nExpressing gratitude\nListening to music\nSkills\nTrilingual (English, Portuguese, Italian)\nR\nMATLAB and Neurobehavioral Systems Presentation programming\nMicrosoft Office\nAdobe Acrobat, Photoshop and Illustrator\nLogo design\nDistill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing, native to the web.\nLearn more about using Distill for R Markdown at https://rstudio.github.io/distill.\n\n\n\n",
