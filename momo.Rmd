## Bio

I’m a calico cat, originally born in Delray Beach, FL but have traveled all the way across the country to Corvallis, OR. I followed this cat to this house one day and next thing you know, I had food, a home and so much love!

I was named after the lemur from Avatar: The Last Airbender, one of my human’s favorite TV shows. She says I look like him because of my big eyes and ears, but I don’t really see it.

I like to sleep during the day and wake my human up at 3am with the zoomies. I’m an energetic and curious lil gal who also loves cuddles, sleeping, licks and human food :)

## Interests
