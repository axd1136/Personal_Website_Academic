## Bio

I grew up in New Jersey and completed my undergraduate career in sun-soaked Coral Gables, FL. I graduated from the University of Miami (Go 'Canes!) in May of 2021 with departmental honors and a Bachelor of Science in Psychology with minors in Art and Chemistry. After trekking across the country with [my adorable cat, Momo](momo.html), I am currently working as a post-baccalaureate lab manager at the [Biology and Emotion of Addiction Via Experimental and Reproducible Science (BEAVERS) Laboratory](https://beaverslab.com/), part of the [School of Psychological Science at Oregon State University](https://catalog.oregonstate.edu/college-departments/liberal-arts/school-psychological-sciences/) in Corvallis, OR. We examine the complex psychophysiological relationship between addiction, substance use and affect (e.g., anxiety).

In the future, I plan on applying to Clinical Psychology Ph.D. programs in pursuit of reforming the clinical realm and reducing stigma surrounding mental health issues. I am particularly interested in emotional dysregulation, psychotherapy techniques, psychedelic medicine and mindfulness research. I hope to one day be able to combine these interests into research and treatment of addiction, emotional disorders and trauma. In the end, my goals are to help individuals find healing and attenuate the stigma surrounding mental health issues.

As a Latina, queer woman, I am incredibly passionate about diversity, equity and inclusion of all individuals in all spaces. I strive to create safe spaces of *acceptance* in each of my interactions. I am also an advocate of [open science practices](https://osf.io/) -- including reproducibility and transparency.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, creating art of many kinds, listening to music, walking in nature, practicing yoga, expressing gratitude and watching documentaries.
